# 50 ASP.NET Web API Interview Questions for Freshers

## Basic Concepts & Definitions (1-20)

**1. What is ASP.NET Web API?**
ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building HTTP-based services that can be consumed by a variety of clients including browsers, mobile applications, and desktop applications. It's part of the ASP.NET framework and is ideal for creating RESTful services.

**2. What is REST and RESTful services?**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. RESTful services follow REST principles:
- Stateless communication
- Client-server architecture
- Cacheable responses
- Uniform interface
- Layered system

**3. What are HTTP verbs? List the main ones used in Web API.**
HTTP verbs define the action to be performed:
- **GET**: Retrieve data (Read operation)
- **POST**: Create new resource
- **PUT**: Update entire resource
- **PATCH**: Partial update of resource
- **DELETE**: Remove resource
- **HEAD**: Get headers only
- **OPTIONS**: Get supported methods

**4. What is the difference between Web API and Web Services?**
- **Web API**: Lightweight, supports HTTP protocol, can return data in multiple formats (JSON, XML)
- **Web Services**: Uses SOAP protocol, XML-based, more heavyweight, platform-independent

**5. What is the difference between Web API and MVC?**
- **Web API**: Designed for creating HTTP services, returns data, no views
- **MVC**: Designed for web applications, returns views (HTML), follows Model-View-Controller pattern

**6. What is JSON and why is it preferred in Web API?**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format. It's preferred because:
- Lightweight and fast
- Easy to read and write
- Native JavaScript support
- Less verbose than XML

**7. What is a Controller in Web API?**
A controller is a class that handles HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. It contains action methods that correspond to different HTTP operations.

```csharp
public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
    public string Get()
    {
        return "Hello from Web API";
    }
}
```

**8. What is an Action Method?**
An action method is a public method in a controller that handles HTTP requests. Each action method typically corresponds to a specific HTTP verb and URL pattern.

**9. What is Routing in Web API?**
Routing is the mechanism that maps incoming HTTP requests to specific controller actions based on URL patterns. It determines which controller and action method should handle a request.

**10. What are the types of routing in Web API?**
- **Convention-based routing**: Uses URL patterns defined in route tables
- **Attribute routing**: Uses attributes directly on controllers and actions

```csharp
// Attribute routing example
[Route("api/products/{id}")]
public string GetProduct(int id)
{
    return $"Product {id}";
}
```

**11. What is Model Binding?**
Model binding is the process of creating .NET objects from HTTP request data (query strings, form data, route data, request body). It automatically maps request data to action method parameters.

**12. What is Serialization and Deserialization?**
- **Serialization**: Converting .NET objects to formats like JSON or XML for transmission
- **Deserialization**: Converting JSON/XML back to .NET objects
Web API handles this automatically using formatters.

**13. What is Content Negotiation?**
Content negotiation is the process where the server selects the best response format (JSON, XML, etc.) based on what the client can accept, specified in the Accept header.

**14. What is Status Code? List common HTTP status codes.**
Status codes indicate the result of HTTP requests:
- **200 OK**: Success
- **201 Created**: Resource created successfully
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server error

**15. What is the ApiController class?**
ApiController is the base class for Web API controllers. It provides functionality specific to handling HTTP requests and responses, including model binding, content negotiation, and action filters.

**16. What is the difference between ApiController and Controller?**
- **ApiController**: Designed for Web API, focuses on data, no view support
- **Controller**: Designed for MVC, supports views, has ViewBag, ViewData

**17. What are Action Filters?**
Action filters are attributes that run code before or after action method execution. They provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, caching.

**18. What is Dependency Injection?**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where dependencies are provided to an object rather than the object creating them itself. It promotes loose coupling and easier testing.

```csharp
public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
    private IProductService _productService;
    
    public ProductsController(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService; // Dependency injected
    }
}
```

**19. What is CORS?**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web applications running at one domain to access resources from another domain. It's essential for web APIs consumed by browser-based applications.

**20. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**
- **Authentication**: Verifying who the user is (login process)
- **Authorization**: Determining what the authenticated user can access (permissions)

## Web API Components & Architecture (21-35)

**21. What is a Media Type Formatter?**
Media type formatters are responsible for serializing and deserializing data between .NET objects and HTTP message bodies. Common formatters include JSON and XML formatters.

**22. What is Global.asax in Web API?**
Global.asax is an application file that handles application-level events. In Web API, it's used to configure routes, filters, and other application-wide settings.

**23. What is WebApiConfig?**
WebApiConfig is a configuration class where you set up Web API routes, formatters, filters, and other configuration settings.

```csharp
public static class WebApiConfig
{
    public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
    {
        config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
            name: "DefaultApi",
            routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
            defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
        );
    }
}
```

**24. What is HttpConfiguration?**
HttpConfiguration is the main configuration object for Web API. It contains settings for routes, formatters, filters, message handlers, and other Web API components.

**25. What are Message Handlers?**
Message handlers process HTTP requests and responses at a lower level than controllers. They can inspect, log, or modify requests/responses before they reach the controller.

**26. What is the Web API pipeline?**
The Web API pipeline is the sequence of components that process an HTTP request:
1. Message Handlers
2. Routing
3. Controller Selection
4. Action Selection
5. Model Binding
6. Action Filters
7. Action Execution
8. Response

**27. What is IActionResult?**
IActionResult represents the result of an action method in ASP.NET Core Web API. It encapsulates the HTTP response including status code, headers, and content.

```csharp
public IActionResult Get(int id)
{
    var product = GetProduct(id);
    if (product == null)
        return NotFound();
    return Ok(product);
}
```

**28. What is the difference between IActionResult and ActionResult<T>?**
- **IActionResult**: Base interface for all action results, doesn't specify return type
- **ActionResult<T>**: Strongly typed, allows returning either T directly or IActionResult, provides better IntelliSense and API documentation

```csharp
// ActionResult<T> example
public ActionResult<Product> Get(int id)
{
    var product = GetProduct(id);
    if (product == null)
        return NotFound(); // Returns IActionResult
    return product;        // Returns Product directly
}
```

**29. What are the different ways to return data from Web API?**
- Return specific types (string, object)
- Return IActionResult
- Return ActionResult<T>
- Return Task<T> for async operations

**30. What are Services in ASP.NET Core?**
Services are objects that provide functionality to your application. They are registered in the Dependency Injection (DI) container and can be injected into controllers or other services.

```csharp
public interface IProductService
{
    Task<Product> GetProductAsync(int id);
}

public class ProductService : IProductService
{
    public async Task<Product> GetProductAsync(int id)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// Registration in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();
```

**31. What is the difference between AddScoped, AddTransient, and AddSingleton?**
- **AddSingleton**: One instance for the entire application lifetime
- **AddScoped**: One instance per HTTP request
- **AddTransient**: New instance every time it's requested

**32. What is ApplicationDbContext?**
ApplicationDbContext is a class that inherits from DbContext (Entity Framework). It represents a session with the database and provides DbSet properties for each entity type.

```csharp
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) 
        : base(options) { }
    
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
}
```

**33. What is DbContext?**
DbContext is the primary class in Entity Framework that coordinates Entity Framework functionality for a data model. It manages database connections, tracks changes, and provides CRUD operations.

**34. What is Entity Framework (EF)?**
Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers to work with databases using .NET objects instead of writing SQL queries directly.

**35. What is Parameter Binding?**
Parameter binding is how Web API gets values for action method parameters from the HTTP request. It can bind from:
- URL (route data)
- Query string
- Request body
- Headers

**36. What is the [FromBody] attribute?**
[FromBody] tells Web API to bind a parameter from the HTTP request body. By default, complex types are bound from the body.

```csharp
public IActionResult Post([FromBody] Product product)
{
    // product is bound from request body
}
```

**37. What is the [FromUri] attribute vs [FromQuery] attribute?**
- **[FromUri]**: Used in Web API 2, binds parameter from URI (route data or query string)
- **[FromQuery]**: Used in ASP.NET Core, binds parameter from query string only

**38. What is the [FromRoute] attribute?**
[FromRoute] binds a parameter from the route data (URL path segments).

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public IActionResult Get([FromRoute] int id)
{
    // id comes from URL path
}
```

**39. What is the [FromHeader] attribute?**
[FromHeader] binds a parameter from HTTP request headers.

```csharp
public IActionResult Get([FromHeader] string authorization)
{
    // authorization comes from Authorization header
}
```

**40. What is the [FromForm] attribute?**
[FromForm] binds a parameter from form data in the request body.

**41. What is Model Validation?**
Model validation ensures that data sent to the API meets specified requirements. It uses validation attributes like [Required], [Range], [StringLength].

```csharp
public class Product
{
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    [Range(0, 1000)]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

**42. What is ModelState?**
ModelState represents the state of model binding and validation. It contains information about which properties failed validation and why.

```csharp
public IActionResult Post(Product product)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        return BadRequest(ModelState);
    
    // Process valid model
}
```

**43. What are Data Annotations?**
Data annotations are attributes used to define validation rules, display information, and data relationships for model properties.

**44. What is ControllerBase vs Controller?**
- **ControllerBase**: Base class for API controllers, no view support
- **Controller**: Inherits from ControllerBase, adds view-related functionality for MVC

**45. What is the [ApiController] attribute?**
[ApiController] attribute enables several API-specific behaviors:
- Automatic HTTP 400 responses for validation errors
- Binding source parameter inference
- Multipart/form-data request inference

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    // Actions
}
```

**46. What is Exception Handling in Web API?**
Exception handling in Web API manages errors that occur during request processing. It can be done through:
- Try-catch blocks
- Exception filters
- Global exception handling

## HTTP & Request/Response (47-50)

**47. What is an HTTP Request?**
An HTTP request consists of:
- Request line (method, URL, HTTP version)
- Headers (metadata about the request)
- Message body (data being sent)

**48. What is an HTTP Response?**
An HTTP response consists of:
- Status line (HTTP version, status code, reason phrase)
- Headers (metadata about the response)
- Message body (response data)

**49. What is the Accept header?**
The Accept header specifies the media types that the client can handle in the response (e.g., application/json, application/xml).

**50. What is the Content-Type header?**
The Content-Type header specifies the media type of the request/response body (e.g., application/json for JSON data).

## Additional Important Definitions for Freshers:

**What is Program.cs in ASP.NET Core?**
Program.cs is the entry point of an ASP.NET Core application. It configures services and the request pipeline.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure pipeline
app.UseRouting();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

**What is Startup.cs vs Program.cs?**
- **Startup.cs**: Used in older ASP.NET Core versions, separate ConfigureServices and Configure methods
- **Program.cs**: Used in .NET 6+, simplified approach with top-level statements

**What is Middleware?**
Middleware is software that sits between different components of an application. In ASP.NET Core, middleware components handle HTTP requests and responses in a pipeline.

**What is appsettings.json?**
appsettings.json is a configuration file that stores application settings like connection strings, API keys, and other configuration values.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {

    "BaseUrl": "https://api.example.com"
  }
}
```

**What is Configuration in ASP.NET Core?**
Configuration provides a way to read settings from various sources like appsettings.json, environment variables, command line arguments, etc.

**What is IConfiguration?**
IConfiguration is an interface used to access configuration values from various sources. It's injected into controllers and services.

```csharp
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IConfiguration _configuration;
    
    public ProductsController(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _configuration = configuration;
    }
    
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        var connectionString = _configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
        var apiKey = _configuration["ApiSettings:ApiKey"];
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

**What is Options Pattern?**
Options pattern uses classes to represent groups of related settings. It provides strongly typed access to configuration.

```csharp
public class ApiSettings
{
    public string BaseUrl { get; set; }
    public string ApiKey { get; set; }
}

// Registration
builder.Services.Configure<ApiSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ApiSettings"));

// Usage
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ApiSettings _apiSettings;
    
    public ProductsController(IOptions<ApiSettings> options)
    {
        _apiSettings = options.Value;
    }
}
```

**What is the difference between IOptions, IOptionsSnapshot, and IOptionsMonitor?**
- **IOptions<T>**: Singleton, doesn't reload configuration changes
- **IOptionsSnapshot<T>**: Scoped, reloads per request
- **IOptionsMonitor<T>**: Singleton, reloads when configuration changes

**What is Environment in ASP.NET Core?**
Environment represents the application's runtime environment (Development, Staging, Production). It affects configuration and behavior.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
    }
}
```

**What is IWebHostEnvironment?**
IWebHostEnvironment provides information about the web hosting environment, including content root path, web root path, and environment name.

**What is Logging in ASP.NET Core?**
Logging provides a way to record application events and errors. ASP.NET Core has built-in logging providers.

```csharp
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILogger<ProductsController> _logger;
    
    public ProductsController(ILogger<ProductsController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
    
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Getting all products");
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

**What are the different Log Levels?**
- **Trace**: Most detailed, typically for debugging
- **Debug**: Debugging information
- **Information**: General application flow
- **Warning**: Unexpected but not error conditions
- **Error**: Error conditions
- **Critical**: Critical failures

**What is ILogger vs ILogger<T>?**
- **ILogger**: Non-generic logger interface
- **ILogger<T>**: Generic logger with category name based on type T

**What is Async/Await?**
Async/await is a pattern for writing asynchronous code that doesn't block threads, improving application scalability.

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> GetProductsAsync()
{
    var products = await _productService.GetAllProductsAsync();
    return Ok(products);
}
```

**What is the difference between Task and Task<T>?**
- **Task**: Represents an asynchronous operation with no return value
- **Task<T>**: Represents an asynchronous operation that returns a value of type T

**What is ConfigureAwait(false)?**
ConfigureAwait(false) prevents deadlocks by not capturing the synchronization context when awaiting.

```csharp
public async Task<Product> GetProductAsync(int id)
{
    var product = await _repository.GetAsync(id).ConfigureAwait(false);
    return product;
}
```

**What is HttpContext?**
HttpContext provides access to information about the current HTTP request and response, including headers, user information, and request data.

```csharp
public IActionResult Get()
{
    var userAgent = HttpContext.Request.Headers["User-Agent"];
    var ipAddress = HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress;
    return Ok();
}
```

**What is HttpRequest and HttpResponse?**
- **HttpRequest**: Contains information about the incoming HTTP request
- **HttpResponse**: Used to build the HTTP response sent back to the client

**What is Claims-based Authentication?**
Claims-based authentication uses claims (key-value pairs) to represent user identity and attributes.

```csharp
var claims = new[]
{
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, "john.doe"),
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, "john@example.com"),
    new Claim("role", "admin")
};
```

**What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?**
JWT is a compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties. It consists of Header, Payload, and Signature.

**What is Bearer Token?**
Bearer token is an authentication scheme where the client sends a token in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**What is the difference between Cookie and Token authentication?**
- **Cookie**: Server-side sessions, stateful, automatic browser handling
- **Token**: Stateless, client stores token, manual handling required

**What is HTTPS and SSL/TLS?**
- **HTTPS**: HTTP over SSL/TLS, encrypts communication

**What is API Gateway?**
API Gateway is a server that acts as an API proxy, routing requests to appropriate microservices and handling cross-cutting concerns.

**What is Microservices?**
Microservices is an architectural pattern where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services.

**What is Monolithic vs Microservices architecture?**
- **Monolithic**: Single deployable unit, all components tightly coupled
- **Microservices**: Multiple independent services, loosely coupled

**What is Repository Pattern?**
Repository pattern encapsulates data access logic and provides a uniform interface for accessing data.

```csharp
public interface IProductRepository
{
    Task<Product> GetByIdAsync(int id);
    Task<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllAsync();
    Task AddAsync(Product product);
    Task UpdateAsync(Product product);

}
```

**What is Unit of Work Pattern?**
Unit of Work pattern maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates writing out changes as a single unit.

**What is DTO (Data Transfer Object)?**
DTO is an object that carries data between processes, often used to transfer data between API layers.

```csharp
public class ProductDto
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

**What is AutoMapper?**
AutoMapper is a library that automatically maps objects of one type to another, commonly used for Entity to DTO mapping.

// Configuration
CreateMap<Product, ProductDto>();

// Usage
var productDto = _mapper.Map<ProductDto>(product);
```

**What is FluentValidation?**
FluentValidation is a library for building strongly-typed validation rules using a fluent interface.

```csharp
public class ProductValidator : AbstractValidator<Product>
{
    public ProductValidator()
    {

**What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?**
CORS allows web applications from one domain to access resources from another domain by adding specific HTTP headers.

**What is the Same-Origin Policy?**
Same-Origin Policy is a security concept that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain, protocol, or port.

**What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?**
CSP is a security standard that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded.

**What is Rate Limiting?**
Rate limiting controls the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specific time period.

**What is Caching?**
Caching temporarily stores frequently accessed data to improve application performance and reduce database load.

**What are the types of Caching?**
- **In-Memory Caching**: Stores data in application memory

## ASP.NET MVC Questions (51-75)

**51. What is ASP.NET MVC?**
ASP.NET MVC is a web application framework that implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It separates application logic into three interconnected components.

**52. What is the MVC Pattern?**
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components:
- **Model**: Represents data and business logic
- **View**: Handles the display of information (UI)
- **Controller**: Manages user input and coordinates between Model and View

**53. What is the difference between MVC and Web API?**
- **MVC**: Designed for web applications, returns HTML views, supports both data and UI
- **Web API**: Designed for HTTP services, returns data (JSON/XML), no UI support

**54. What is a Controller in MVC?**
A Controller is a class that handles user requests, processes input, interacts with models, and returns appropriate responses (usually views).

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
    
    public IActionResult About()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

**55. What is an Action Method in MVC?**
An Action Method is a public method in a controller that handles HTTP requests and returns an ActionResult.

**56. What are the different types of ActionResult?**
- **ViewResult**: Returns a view
- **PartialViewResult**: Returns a partial view
- **RedirectResult**: Redirects to another URL
- **RedirectToActionResult**: Redirects to another action
- **JsonResult**: Returns JSON data
- **ContentResult**: Returns plain text
- **FileResult**: Returns a file
- **EmptyResult**: Returns nothing

**57. What is a View in MVC?**
A View is responsible for rendering the user interface. It's typically an HTML template with embedded server-side code (Razor syntax).

```html
@model List<Product>

<h2>Products</h2>
@foreach(var product in Model)
{
    <div>@product.Name - @product.Price</div>
}
```

**58. What is a Model in MVC?**
A Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It can be:
- Domain models (entities)
- View models (data transfer objects for views)
- Data access models

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

**59. What is Razor View Engine?**
Razor is a markup syntax that allows embedding server-side code into web pages using C# or VB.NET. It uses @ symbol to transition between HTML and server code.

**60. What is the difference between @{ } and @( )?**
- **@{ }**: Code block for statements, doesn't output to HTML
- **@( )**: Expression that outputs the result to HTML

```html
@{
    var message = "Hello World"; // Statement block
}

<p>@(message)</p> <!-- Expression -->
<p>@message</p>   <!-- Shorthand for simple expressions -->
```

**61. What is ViewBag, ViewData, and TempData?**
- **ViewBag**: Dynamic property, uses dynamic keyword
- **ViewData**: Dictionary-based, requires casting
- **TempData**: Persists data across requests, uses session

```csharp
// Controller
ViewBag.Message = "Hello from ViewBag";
ViewData["Message"] = "Hello from ViewData";
TempData["Message"] = "Hello from TempData";

// View
<p>@ViewBag.Message</p>
<p>@ViewData["Message"]</p>
<p>@TempData["Message"]</p>
```

**62. What is the difference between ViewBag and ViewData?**
- **ViewBag**: Dynamic, no casting required, compile-time error checking
- **ViewData**: Dictionary, requires casting, runtime errors

**63. What is a ViewModel?**
A ViewModel is a model specifically designed for a view, containing only the data needed for that particular view.

```csharp
public class ProductViewModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public bool IsAvailable { get; set; }
}
```

**64. What is Model Binding in MVC?**
Model Binding automatically maps HTTP request data to action method parameters or model objects.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(Product product)
{
    // product object is automatically bound from form data
    return View(product);
}
```

**65. What is Routing in MVC?**
Routing maps URLs to controller actions. It determines which controller and action should handle a request.

```csharp
// Convention-based routing
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

// Attribute routing
[Route("products/{id:int}")]
public IActionResult Details(int id)
{
    return View();
}
```

**66. What is the difference between Convention-based and Attribute routing?**
- **Convention-based**: Uses URL patterns defined globally
- **Attribute**: Uses attributes directly on controllers/actions for more control

**67. What are Action Filters in MVC?**
Action Filters are attributes that run code before or after action execution. They provide cross-cutting functionality.

```csharp
public class LogActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        // Code before action execution
    }
    
    public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        // Code after action execution
    }
}

[LogActionFilter]
public IActionResult Index()
{
    return View();
}
```

**68. What are the types of Filters in MVC?**
- **Authorization Filters**: Handle authentication and authorization
- **Action Filters**: Run before and after action methods
- **Result Filters**: Run before and after action results
- **Exception Filters**: Handle exceptions
- **Resource Filters**: Run early in the pipeline

**69. What is Partial View?**
A Partial View is a reusable view component that renders part of a web page. It's like a user control.

```html
<!-- Partial View: _ProductCard.cshtml -->
@model Product
<div class="product-card">
    <h3>@Model.Name</h3>
    <p>@Model.Price</p>
</div>

<!-- Usage in main view -->
@Html.Partial("_ProductCard", product)
@await Html.PartialAsync("_ProductCard", product)
```

**70. What is Layout in MVC?**
Layout defines the common structure of web pages (header, footer, navigation). Views use layouts to maintain consistent appearance.

```html
<!-- _Layout.cshtml -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>@ViewBag.Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header><!-- Header content --></header>
    
    @RenderBody() <!-- View content goes here -->
    
    <footer><!-- Footer content --></footer>
    
    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
</body>
</html>
```

**71. What is @RenderBody() and @RenderSection()?**
- **@RenderBody()**: Renders the main content of the view
- **@RenderSection()**: Renders optional sections defined in views

```html
<!-- In Layout -->
@RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)

<!-- In View -->
@section Scripts {
    <script src="~/js/custom.js"></script>
}
```

**72. What is Bundling and Minification?**
- **Bundling**: Combines multiple files into single files to reduce HTTP requests
- **Minification**: Removes unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments) to reduce file size

```csharp
// In ASP.NET Core
builder.Services.AddWebOptimizer(pipeline =>
{
    pipeline.AddCssBundle("/css/bundle.css", "css/site.css", "css/bootstrap.css");
    pipeline.AddJavaScriptBundle("/js/bundle.js", "js/site.js", "js/custom.js");
});
```

**73. What is Html Helper?**
Html Helpers are methods that generate HTML markup. They provide a programmatic way to create HTML elements.

```html
@Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.Name)
@Html.DropDownListFor(m => m.CategoryId, ViewBag.Categories as SelectList)
@Html.ActionLink("Details", "Details", new { id = item.Id })
@Html.BeginForm("Create", "Product")
```

**74. What is the difference between Html.Partial() and Html.RenderPartial()?**
- **Html.Partial()**: Returns HTML string, can be stored in variable
- **Html.RenderPartial()**: Writes directly to response stream, slightly better performance

```html
@Html.Partial("_ProductCard", model)

@{ Html.RenderPartial("_ProductCard", model); }
```

**75. What is Areas in MVC?**
Areas provide a way to organize large MVC applications into smaller functional groups, each with its own controllers, views, and models.

```csharp
// Area registration
[Area("Admin")]
public class ProductController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
}

// Routing for areas
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "areas",
    pattern: "{area:exists}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
```

## Key MVC Concepts Summary:

**MVC Architecture Benefits:**
- Separation of concerns
- Testability
- Parallel development
- Reusability
- Maintainability

**Common MVC Folder Structure:**
- Controllers/ - Controller classes
- Views/ - Razor view files  
- Models/ - Model classes
- wwwroot/ - Static files (CSS, JS, images)

**MVC Request Lifecycle:**
1. Route resolution
2. Controller instantiation
3. Action method execution
4. Result execution
5. View rendering
6. Response sent to client

## Key Points for Freshers:
- Focus on understanding basic concepts before jumping to implementation
- Practice creating simple Web API controllers
- Understand HTTP fundamentals
- Learn about REST principles
- Understand the difference between various return types
- Practice with JSON serialization/deserialization
- Understand basic routing concepts
- Learn about common HTTP status codes and when to use them
