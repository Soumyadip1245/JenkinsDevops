# 50 ASP.NET Web API Interview Questions for Freshers

## Basic Concepts & Definitions (1-20)

**1. What is ASP.NET Web API?**
ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building HTTP-based services that can be consumed by a variety of clients including browsers, mobile applications, and desktop applications. It's part of the ASP.NET framework and is ideal for creating RESTful services.

**2. What is REST and RESTful services?**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. RESTful services follow REST principles:
- Stateless communication
- Client-server architecture
- Cacheable responses
- Uniform interface
- Layered system

**3. What are HTTP verbs? List the main ones used in Web API.**
HTTP verbs define the action to be performed:
- **GET**: Retrieve data (Read operation)
- **POST**: Create new resource
- **PUT**: Update entire resource
- **PATCH**: Partial update of resource
- **DELETE**: Remove resource
- **HEAD**: Get headers only
- **OPTIONS**: Get supported methods

**4. What is the difference between Web API and Web Services?**
- **Web API**: Lightweight, supports HTTP protocol, can return data in multiple formats (JSON, XML)
- **Web Services**: Uses SOAP protocol, XML-based, more heavyweight, platform-independent

**5. What is the difference between Web API and MVC?**
- **Web API**: Designed for creating HTTP services, returns data, no views
- **MVC**: Designed for web applications, returns views (HTML), follows Model-View-Controller pattern

**6. What is JSON and why is it preferred in Web API?**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format. It's preferred because:
- Lightweight and fast
- Easy to read and write
- Native JavaScript support
- Less verbose than XML

**7. What is a Controller in Web API?**
A controller is a class that handles HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. It contains action methods that correspond to different HTTP operations.

```csharp
public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
    public string Get()
    {
        return "Hello from Web API";
    }
}
```

**8. What is an Action Method?**
An action method is a public method in a controller that handles HTTP requests. Each action method typically corresponds to a specific HTTP verb and URL pattern.

**9. What is Routing in Web API?**
Routing is the mechanism that maps incoming HTTP requests to specific controller actions based on URL patterns. It determines which controller and action method should handle a request.

**10. What are the types of routing in Web API?**
- **Convention-based routing**: Uses URL patterns defined in route tables
- **Attribute routing**: Uses attributes directly on controllers and actions

```csharp
// Attribute routing example
[Route("api/products/{id}")]
public string GetProduct(int id)
{
    return $"Product {id}";
}
```

**11. What is Model Binding?**
Model binding is the process of creating .NET objects from HTTP request data (query strings, form data, route data, request body). It automatically maps request data to action method parameters.

**12. What is Serialization and Deserialization?**
- **Serialization**: Converting .NET objects to formats like JSON or XML for transmission
- **Deserialization**: Converting JSON/XML back to .NET objects
Web API handles this automatically using formatters.

**13. What is Content Negotiation?**
Content negotiation is the process where the server selects the best response format (JSON, XML, etc.) based on what the client can accept, specified in the Accept header.

**14. What is Status Code? List common HTTP status codes.**
Status codes indicate the result of HTTP requests:
- **200 OK**: Success
- **201 Created**: Resource created successfully
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server error

**15. What is the ApiController class?**
ApiController is the base class for Web API controllers. It provides functionality specific to handling HTTP requests and responses, including model binding, content negotiation, and action filters.

**16. What is the difference between ApiController and Controller?**
- **ApiController**: Designed for Web API, focuses on data, no view support
- **Controller**: Designed for MVC, supports views, has ViewBag, ViewData

**17. What are Action Filters?**
Action filters are attributes that run code before or after action method execution. They provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, caching.

**18. What is Dependency Injection?**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where dependencies are provided to an object rather than the object creating them itself. It promotes loose coupling and easier testing.

```csharp
public class ProductsController : ApiController
{
    private IProductService _productService;
    
    public ProductsController(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService; // Dependency injected
    }
}
```

**19. What is CORS?**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web applications running at one domain to access resources from another domain. It's essential for web APIs consumed by browser-based applications.

**20. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?**
- **Authentication**: Verifying who the user is (login process)
- **Authorization**: Determining what the authenticated user can access (permissions)

## Web API Components & Architecture (21-35)

**21. What is a Media Type Formatter?**
Media type formatters are responsible for serializing and deserializing data between .NET objects and HTTP message bodies. Common formatters include JSON and XML formatters.

**22. What is Global.asax in Web API?**
Global.asax is an application file that handles application-level events. In Web API, it's used to configure routes, filters, and other application-wide settings.

**23. What is WebApiConfig?**
WebApiConfig is a configuration class where you set up Web API routes, formatters, filters, and other configuration settings.

```csharp
public static class WebApiConfig
{
    public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
    {
        config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
            name: "DefaultApi",
            routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
            defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
        );
    }
}
```

**24. What is HttpConfiguration?**
HttpConfiguration is the main configuration object for Web API. It contains settings for routes, formatters, filters, message handlers, and other Web API components.

**25. What are Message Handlers?**
Message handlers process HTTP requests and responses at a lower level than controllers. They can inspect, log, or modify requests/responses before they reach the controller.

**26. What is the Web API pipeline?**
The Web API pipeline is the sequence of components that process an HTTP request:
1. Message Handlers
2. Routing
3. Controller Selection
4. Action Selection
5. Model Binding
6. Action Filters
7. Action Execution
8. Response

**27. What is IActionResult?**
IActionResult represents the result of an action method in ASP.NET Core Web API. It encapsulates the HTTP response including status code, headers, and content.

```csharp
public IActionResult Get(int id)
{
    var product = GetProduct(id);
    if (product == null)
        return NotFound();
    return Ok(product);
}
```

**28. What is the difference between IActionResult and ActionResult<T>?**
- **IActionResult**: Base interface for all action results, doesn't specify return type
- **ActionResult<T>**: Strongly typed, allows returning either T directly or IActionResult, provides better IntelliSense and API documentation

```csharp
// ActionResult<T> example
public ActionResult<Product> Get(int id)
{
    var product = GetProduct(id);
    if (product == null)
        return NotFound(); // Returns IActionResult
    return product;        // Returns Product directly
}
```

**29. What are the different ways to return data from Web API?**
- Return specific types (string, object)
- Return IActionResult
- Return ActionResult<T>
- Return Task<T> for async operations

**30. What are Services in ASP.NET Core?**
Services are objects that provide functionality to your application. They are registered in the Dependency Injection (DI) container and can be injected into controllers or other services.

```csharp
public interface IProductService
{
    Task<Product> GetProductAsync(int id);
}

public class ProductService : IProductService
{
    public async Task<Product> GetProductAsync(int id)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// Registration in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();
```

**31. What is the difference between AddScoped, AddTransient, and AddSingleton?**
- **AddSingleton**: One instance for the entire application lifetime
- **AddScoped**: One instance per HTTP request
- **AddTransient**: New instance every time it's requested

**32. What is ApplicationDbContext?**
ApplicationDbContext is a class that inherits from DbContext (Entity Framework). It represents a session with the database and provides DbSet properties for each entity type.

```csharp
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) 
        : base(options) { }
    
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
}
```

**33. What is DbContext?**
DbContext is the primary class in Entity Framework that coordinates Entity Framework functionality for a data model. It manages database connections, tracks changes, and provides CRUD operations.

**34. What is Entity Framework (EF)?**
Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows developers to work with databases using .NET objects instead of writing SQL queries directly.

**35. What is Parameter Binding?**
Parameter binding is how Web API gets values for action method parameters from the HTTP request. It can bind from:
- URL (route data)
- Query string
- Request body
- Headers

**36. What is the [FromBody] attribute?**
[FromBody] tells Web API to bind a parameter from the HTTP request body. By default, complex types are bound from the body.

```csharp
public IActionResult Post([FromBody] Product product)
{
    // product is bound from request body
}
```

**37. What is the [FromUri] attribute vs [FromQuery] attribute?**
- **[FromUri]**: Used in Web API 2, binds parameter from URI (route data or query string)
- **[FromQuery]**: Used in ASP.NET Core, binds parameter from query string only

**38. What is the [FromRoute] attribute?**
[FromRoute] binds a parameter from the route data (URL path segments).

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public IActionResult Get([FromRoute] int id)
{
    // id comes from URL path
}
```

**39. What is the [FromHeader] attribute?**
[FromHeader] binds a parameter from HTTP request headers.

```csharp
public IActionResult Get([FromHeader] string authorization)
{
    // authorization comes from Authorization header
}
```

**40. What is the [FromForm] attribute?**
[FromForm] binds a parameter from form data in the request body.

**41. What is Model Validation?**
Model validation ensures that data sent to the API meets specified requirements. It uses validation attributes like [Required], [Range], [StringLength].

```csharp
public class Product
{
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    [Range(0, 1000)]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

**42. What is ModelState?**
ModelState represents the state of model binding and validation. It contains information about which properties failed validation and why.

```csharp
public IActionResult Post(Product product)
{
    if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        return BadRequest(ModelState);
    
    // Process valid model
}
```

**43. What are Data Annotations?**
Data annotations are attributes used to define validation rules, display information, and data relationships for model properties.

**44. What is ControllerBase vs Controller?**
- **ControllerBase**: Base class for API controllers, no view support
- **Controller**: Inherits from ControllerBase, adds view-related functionality for MVC

**45. What is the [ApiController] attribute?**
[ApiController] attribute enables several API-specific behaviors:
- Automatic HTTP 400 responses for validation errors
- Binding source parameter inference
- Multipart/form-data request inference

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    // Actions
}
```

**46. What is Exception Handling in Web API?**
Exception handling in Web API manages errors that occur during request processing. It can be done through:
- Try-catch blocks
- Exception filters
- Global exception handling

## HTTP & Request/Response (47-50)

**47. What is an HTTP Request?**
An HTTP request consists of:
- Request line (method, URL, HTTP version)
- Headers (metadata about the request)
- Message body (data being sent)

**48. What is an HTTP Response?**
An HTTP response consists of:
- Status line (HTTP version, status code, reason phrase)
- Headers (metadata about the response)
- Message body (response data)

**49. What is the Accept header?**
The Accept header specifies the media types that the client can handle in the response (e.g., application/json, application/xml).

**50. What is the Content-Type header?**
The Content-Type header specifies the media type of the request/response body (e.g., application/json for JSON data).

## Additional Important Definitions for Freshers:

**What is Program.cs in ASP.NET Core?**
Program.cs is the entry point of an ASP.NET Core application. It configures services and the request pipeline.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services
builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure pipeline
app.UseRouting();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

**What is Startup.cs vs Program.cs?**
- **Startup.cs**: Used in older ASP.NET Core versions, separate ConfigureServices and Configure methods
- **Program.cs**: Used in .NET 6+, simplified approach with top-level statements

**What is Middleware?**
Middleware is software that sits between different components of an application. In ASP.NET Core, middleware components handle HTTP requests and responses in a pipeline.

**What is appsettings.json?**
appsettings.json is a configuration file that stores application settings like connection strings, API keys, and other configuration values.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=MyDb;Trusted_Connection=true;"
  },
  "ApiSettings": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://api.example.com"
  }
}
```

**What is Configuration in ASP.NET Core?**
Configuration provides a way to read settings from various sources like appsettings.json, environment variables, command line arguments, etc.
